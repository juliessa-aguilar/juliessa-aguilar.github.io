	 "I am many different versions of myself and wear a procession of different masks that are only superficially related.
<br>
<br>
The masks provide structure, much like glue, holding together a previously-shattered vase. When I take them off, I am "betwixt and between," entering a liminal state in which I am stripped of all but my name, an arbitrary symbolic marker of what is essentially a fractured identity."
