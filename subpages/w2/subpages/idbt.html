<h1 class="header">Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</h1>
<p class="text">
	Dialectical behavior therapy is an evidence-based psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat personality disorders, ADHD, and interpersonal conflicts. There is evidence that DBT can be useful in treating mood disorders, suicidal ideation, and for change in behavioral patterns such as self-harm and substance use.
