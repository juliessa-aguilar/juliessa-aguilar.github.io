	<h4 style="color:white;">When tomorrow starts without me
		<br>
		And I'm not here to see
		<br>
		If the sun should rise and find your eyes
		<br>
		All filled with tears for me
		<br>
		I wish you wouldn't cry 
		<br>
		The Way you did today
		<br>
		While thinking of the many things
		<br>
		We did not get to say
		<br>
		I know how much you love me
		<br>
		As much as I love you
		<br>
		Each time that you think of me
		<br>
		I know you will miss me too
		<br>
		<a style="color:white;" href="p1sssp/p1sssp3.html">When tomorrow starts with out me</a>
		<br>
		Please try to understand
		<br>
		That an angel came and called my name
		<br>
		And took me by the hand
		<br>
		The angel said my place was ready
		<br>
		In heaven far above
		<br>
		And That I would have to leave behind
		<br>
		All those I Dearly Love
		<br>
		But When I walked through Heaven's Gates
		<br>
		I felt so much at home
		<br>
		When GOD looked down and smiled at me 
		<br>
		From his golden throne
		<br>
		He said This Is Eternity
		<br>
		And All I promised you
		<br>
		Today for life on earth is done
		<br>
		But Here it starts a new
		<br>
		<a style="color:white;" href="p1sssp/p1sssp4.html">I promise no tomorrow</a>
		<br>
		For today will always last
		<br>
		And Since each day's the exact same way
		<br>
		There is no longing for the past
		<br>
		So When Tomorrow starts without me
		<br>
		Do not think we're apart
		<br>
		For every time you think of me
		<br>
		Remember I'm right here in your heart
