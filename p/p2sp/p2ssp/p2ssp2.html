			Such a man has a <a align="center" style="color:white;" href="p2sssp/p2sssp4.html">double existence</a>: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures."
